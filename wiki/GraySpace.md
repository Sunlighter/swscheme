GraySpace is a program included with Sunlit World Scheme that converts a Scheme source file into a color-syntax-highlighted HTML file.

In addition to highlighting syntactical elements, GraySpace indicates the amount of space that should be used to indent program code (in my indentation style). I use a standard of two spaces for every open parenthesis. Such a style is easy to enforce mechanically.

Sometimes, when a parenthesis is misplaced or missing, Scheme interpreters do not make it clear where the parenthesis should go. GraySpace can help make it obvious where the problem is.
