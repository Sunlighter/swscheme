This project has not been publicly maintained for a while. It _has_ been _privately_ maintained, by me, but has moved in directions I did not anticipate. (It seems like a disorganized heap of partially completed extensions. It always did seem that way...)

A later version of this Scheme will almost certainly appear on Github at some point, under my Sunlighter account there ([https://github.com/Sunlighter/](https://github.com/Sunlighter/)). CodePlex may become read-only before I can get the code out, so I wanted to put up this message so anybody who's interested would know where to look.
